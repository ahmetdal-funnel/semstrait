# semstrait Design — Overview

Status: **Ratified (compressed contract edition)**

This document is the contract for the semstrait design tree. It defines vocabulary, layering rules, invariants, and document ownership boundaries used by all other docs under `docs/design/`.

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

`semstrait` is a semantic modeling and planning layer:

- authors declare Semantics over DataKinds in YAML;
- semstrait compiles YAML into an engine-agnostic `SemanticManifest`;
- query-time planning turns a `Request` into a canonical `SemanticPlan`;
- adapters emit engine-native artifacts (SQL text or structured engine plans).

This design tree specifies **target-state behavior**. Current code is the pre-migration baseline.

Scope boundary:

- **In scope:** canonical model, compile/plan pipeline, API contracts, adapter/catalog seams.
- **Out of scope:** runtime execution inside engines, access control systems, storage lifecycle management.

---

## 2. Audience

- Contributors and reviewers working on semantic architecture and crate contracts.
- AI coding agents operating in spec-driven mode.
- Not an end-user authoring manual; this is an engineering specification.

Required session start for design/spec work:

1. `00_overview.md` (this file)
2. `[STATUS.md](STATUS.md)`

For fast navigation, use `[INDEX.md](INDEX.md)`.

---

## 3. Approach: Canonical-First

semstrait has two conversion boundaries:

1. **YAML -> canonical** at compile time.
2. **canonical -> engine** at adapt time.

Rules:

- Engine vocabulary never leaks into canonical layers.
- Metadata-provider specifics never leak above catalog/provider traits.
- Planner/adapters consume canonical types, not YAML and not engine-specific authoring forms.

Engines and metadata sources are independent axes:

- engines via `semstrait-adapter`;
- metadata sources via `semstrait-catalog`.

---

## 4. Canonical Vocabulary

Detailed semantics live in owning docs. This section is a compact term map; the rightmost column is authoritative.

### 4.2 Core verbs


| Verb             | Meaning                                     | Authoritative doc                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `parse`          | YAML -> `SemanticModel`                     | `apis/32_semstrait_model.md`            |

### 4.3 Banned / deprecated terms

Use canonical terms; avoid stale vocabulary:

- `ColumnMapping` -> `SemanticMapping`
- `DataKindOps` omnibus trait language (retired)
- `IntoDiagnostic` trait language (retired)
- stable numeric error-code subsystem language as source-of-truth (`*_E_####` ownership tables)
- `SemstraitErrorKind` spelling -> use `SemStraitErrorKind`

### 4.4 Precedence rule for apparent conflicts

If docs disagree:

1. Check authoritative owner in this file + `[INDEX.md](INDEX.md)`.
2. Earlier-layer contract beats later-layer elaboration unless explicitly scoped extension.
3. If still conflicting, treat as design bug and amend docs; do not keep dual truth.

## 5. Pipeline at a Glance

Canonical flow:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  model["Model YAML"] --> parse["parse"]
  parse --> validate["validate"]
  validate --> compile["compile"]
  compile --> manifest["SemanticManifest"]
  manifest --> plan["plan"]
  plan --> optimize["optimize"]
  optimize --> adapt["adapt/emit"]
  adapt --> artifact["EngineArtifact"]
```



Hot-path rule: `plan -> optimize -> adapt` is sync and free of hidden I/O.

## 6. Document Map


| Group          | Path                                      | Role                                        |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Overview       | `00_overview.md`, `STATUS.md`, `INDEX.md` | Contract + session state + navigation       |
| Foundations    | `foundations/*`                           | Cross-cutting canonical semantics           |
| DataKinds      | `data-kinds/*`                            | Variant-specific behavior and applicability |
| APIs           | `apis/*`                                  | Per-crate public contract surfaces          |

| Questions      | `questions/{open,closed,deferred}/*`      | Decision lifecycle sidecars                 |


For a task-first entrypoint, use `[INDEX.md](INDEX.md)`.

## 7. Diagram Conventions

Mermaid is the default visual format:

- `flowchart`: data/control flow
- `sequenceDiagram`: lifecycle ordering
- `classDiagram`: type relationships
- `stateDiagram-v2`: state/lifecycle transitions

Use ASCII diagrams (not Mermaid) for:

- memory/index layout details
- bitmaps/offset maps
- scope-chain snapshots

No color semantics; shape and edge style carry meaning.

---

## 8. Cross-Reference Rules

- Use relative markdown links to docs, not code paths.
- Terms from section 4 may be used directly without repeated redefinition.
- Layering directionality:
  - later docs may refine earlier concepts;
  - later docs must not override earlier contracts;
  - scoped extensions must declare scope explicitly.
- Any apparent conflict is a doc defect to reconcile.

---

## 9. Design Invariants

Violations are design bugs.

- **I1** No raw SQL in canonical layers; SQL exists only at adapter emission.
- **I2** Canonical layer uses logical types only; physical types stay in adapters.
- **I3** No engine/provider branching in canonical crates.
- **I4** SemanticManifest determinism for identical `(model, catalog snapshot)` inputs.
- **I5** Name resolution occurs at compile time; planner performs lookup only.
- **I6** `plan -> optimize -> adapt` hot path is synchronous.
- **I7** Crate dependency graph is strict and acyclic.
- **I8** SemanticManifest is planner-complete and planner-optimized.
- **I9** Ratified design docs are source of truth for target state.
- **I10** Public sum-type surfaces are non-exhaustive by default.
- **I11** No hidden query-time I/O in planner hot path; only explicit gated boundaries.
- **I12** First-class typed diagnostics by stage (`*ErrorKind` + `Diagnostic<K>`), with `tracing` as observability channel; no stable numeric code table as canonical source-of-truth.

---

## 10. Out of Scope

Not covered by this design set:

- runtime query execution internals;
- storage lifecycle management (DDL/migrations/evolution);
- authn/authz and tenancy models;
- cost-based optimization;
- lineage/governance systems;
- advanced SQL constructs not in v1 semantic scope (e.g., recursive queries, grouping sets).

Deferred-but-in-scope items are tracked as `DEFERRED` in owning docs and question sidecars.

---

## 11. Relationship to Existing Documents

- `[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)` / `[CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)`: project mode + workflow.
- Legacy docs outside `docs/design/`: current-state reference, not authoritative for target.
- Migration tracking: `implementation/40-42`.

For current session priorities and deferred threads, use `[STATUS.md](STATUS.md)`.

For strict editing discipline and anti-drift rules, use:
