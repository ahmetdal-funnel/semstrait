# 32 — Open Questions

> Two questions remain open: Q-MODEL-005 (expression-surface parse-site audit table) and Q-MODEL-008 (`functions:` YAML block scope). Closed items moved to [`../closed/32_questions.md`](../closed/32_questions.md); deferred items in [`../deferred/32_questions.md`](../deferred/32_questions.md).

## Q-MODEL-005 — Expression-surface parse-site table completeness

**Question.** The model surface contains many sites that parse an `ExprSource` (Dimension `expr:`, Measure `expr:`, Metric `expr:`, Filter `expr:`, etc.). Is there a canonical enumeration of every site that parses an `ExprSource`, so that every site can be covered by an integration test?

**Expanded scope (post-2026-04-17 canonical-entity closure).** The `18`-entity ratifications added several new parse sites that must be included in any audit table:

- **`18 §2.2` (Relationship.keys).** `JoinKeyExprPair { from: ExprSource, to: ExprSource }` — both sides are `SemanticExpr` parse sites; authored at root `relationships:` AND `JoinsetBody.relationships`.
- **`18 §2.2` (Relationship.filter).** Optional residual predicate — `SemanticExpr` parse site.
- **`18 §1.3` (reference-site `expr:` override).** Every `- ref: <name>` entry on a DataKind's `SemanticInterface` may carry a local `expr:` override (Dimension / Measure / Metric) — `SemanticExpr` parse site.
- **`18 §7.1` (DataKindFilter.expr).** `SemanticExpr` parse site — unchanged in shape from the pre-ratification Filter but now ratified canonically.
- **`18 §7.2` (AggregationFilter.expr).** `SemanticExpr` parse site — evaluated inside the aggregation wrapper at compile lowering.
- **`18 §10.1` (SemanticMapping `Expr` variant).** `PhysicalExpr` parse site — distinct from the `Column` / `Literal` variants that dispatch without parsing an expression.

**Refs.**

- `14 §4.2` — `ExprSource` dispatch lives in `semstrait-model` parse sites.
- `14 §2.2` / `§2.3` — `SemanticExpr` vs `PhysicalExpr` admissibility rules.
- `18 §4` / `§6` / `§7` — Dimension / Measure / Metric `expr:` sites (all `SemanticExpr`).
- `18 §2.2` — `Relationship.keys[].from` / `.to` and `Relationship.filter` (all `SemanticExpr`).
- `18 §1.3` — `ref`-site `expr:` override (`SemanticExpr`, inherits carrier rules).
- `18 §7` — Filter taxonomy `expr:` sites (`SemanticExpr`).
- `18 §10.1` — `SemanticMappingValue::Expr(PhysicalExpr)` (`PhysicalExpr`).

**Arguments for tabulation.**

- Makes the wrapper-typing contract auditable: "every site that parses an `ExprSource` MUST dispatch to exactly one of `parse_semantic` or `parse_physical`".
- Integration-test target: enumerate every site, feed it an adversarial `expr:` (e.g. a `Column` reference on a `SemanticExpr` site), assert the expected `ValidateError`.
- Future-proofs against new parse sites silently defaulting to one wrapper without explicit decision.
- With the `18`-entity consolidation adding ~six new parse-site kinds in one ratification pass, the risk of silent drift at the next extension is higher than before.

**Arguments against.**

- The table is maintenance overhead; when a new site is added, the table must be updated.
- The rule is almost-mechanical ("Semantics carriers / Relationship endpoints / Filters → SemanticExpr; Bindings / SemanticMapping.Expr → PhysicalExpr"); author judgement is reliable.

**Current position in `32` / `18`.** Implicit across `32 §5.1` and every `18 §N` that carries an `expr:` field. Not tabulated explicitly in either doc.

**Next step.** Add a short appendix to a future revision of `18` enumerating the exhaustive parse-site table (`18` is the natural home because most parse sites are owned by `18`). Until then, an integration test in `crates/semstrait-model/tests/` maintains the check programmatically (the test enumerates every `ExprSource` field via reflection-style match). Record as `[TD-EXPR-PARSE-SITE-AUDIT]`.

## Q-MODEL-008 — `functions:` YAML block scope

**Question.** `32 §4.5` allows authors to declare adapter-contributed function extensions at the model scope via a `functions:` top-level block. `31 §5.8` already provides `RegistryExtension` impls at the adapter-crate level. Are both needed? If yes, how do per-model declarations interact with global `RegistryExtension` impls?

**Refs.**

- `14a §7.1` — adapter-contributed registry entries via `RegistryExtension`.
- `31 §5.8` — `RegistryExtension` trait surface; folded at `function_registry()` init.
- `32 §4.5` — `functions:` YAML block with `FunctionExtension` entries.
- `14a §7.2` — collision handling: `AdapterFunctionShadowsCore`, `AdapterFunctionCollision`.

**Arguments for keeping both.**

- Global `RegistryExtension` impls are linked-in at workspace-build time. Authors who use a pre-built `semstrait` distribution can't add a function without rebuilding. Per-model `functions:` gives them an escape hatch.
- Per-model declarations are scoped to the model; they don't pollute every other model in the workspace.
- Parallel to dbt's `macros` at package-level: some code lives globally, some lives per-project.

**Arguments for dropping per-model.**

- Two registries = two collision rules = doubled complexity at `compile`.
- Function identity should be process-global per `14a §2.2`; per-model overrides create ambiguity ("does this name mean the clickhouse `quantile_bfloat16` or the per-model one?").
- The v1 use case is speculative — no author has asked for per-model overrides.
- Per-model `functions:` are a security surface ("load arbitrary function definitions from user YAML"); global impls are link-time and auditable.

**Current position in `32`.** Both supported in v1. Collision handling at `compile` per `31 §5.8`.

**Next step.** Defer a concrete decision until a real use-case surfaces. If none by mid-v1, deprecate and remove the `functions:` YAML block in a v2 MINOR; only `RegistryExtension` impls remain. Tracked as `[TD-MODEL-FUNCTIONS-BLOCK]`.
