## Q2 — `ContextLine` placement

Should rich context rendering data live directly on common diagnostic primitives or remain presentation-layer concern?

Current default: not exposed in common public primitive surface.

---

## Q6 — `SourceId` opacity surface (`as_str` / `Display`)

Should both `as_str()` and `Display` remain, or should one be removed for stricter opacity?

Current default: opaque newtype with both convenience surfaces.

---

## Q8 — `is_reserved_tag` source-of-truth

Which source should drive reserved-tag table synchronization (static list vs enum-derived vs fixture-driven)?

Current default: not ratified yet.
