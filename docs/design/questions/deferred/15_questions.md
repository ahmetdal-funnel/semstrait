## Q-MAP-009 — Hive-style partition value type — DEFERRED to v2 (2026-04-27)

**Status: DEFERRED to v2.** Partition extraction (`partition.level: N`) is non-goal in v1 — the v1 metadata extraction surface is **path-only** per `15 §8.0` / `13 §4.7` v1-scope banner / `15 §13 R47`. The compile pass guards `partition: Some(_)` with `COMP_E_0322 MetadataPartitionDeferredV2`. The result-type contract for Hive-style partitions (raw segment vs value-after-`=`, declared override grammar, type-inference fallback) reactivates when v2 ratifies the partition arm.

**Refs.**

- `15 §8.0` — v1 scope: path-only.
- `15 §8.2 / §8.2.1` — v2 design parking with the original options preserved for future reference.
- `15 §11.1 COMP_E_0322` — v1 compile-time guard.
- `15 §13 R31` — entry confirmed `DEFERRED v2`.
- `13 §4.7` — author-side body retained for forward-compat with v1-scope banner.

**Original options (preserved for v2 ratification).**

- **A:** raw value post-`=`, typed `String`. Authors cast downstream via `Expr`.
- **B:** raw value, typed per author-declared partition-column type (new YAML surface).
- **C:** auto-detect from first encountered value.

**Next step.** Address during the v2 partition-extraction ratification pass; the Hive-style result-type decision rolls into the broader partition-arm design.
