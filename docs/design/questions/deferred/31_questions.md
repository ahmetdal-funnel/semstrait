# Deferred Questions — `apis/31_semstrait_core.md`

| ID | Topic | Last known default |
|---|---|---|
| Q5 | visitor shape depth (single method vs enter/exit) | keep single-method for now |
| Q7 | `#[non_exhaustive]` on expression wrappers | keep wrappers exhaustive, inner enum non-exhaustive |

Re-open when expression-resolution implementation requires trait-shape or wrapper-stability changes.
