## Q-ADAPT-002 — Capability consultation site  *[Closed — IR redesign Phase 5, 2026-05-21]*

**Status.** Closed.

**Question.** Should capability gating remain planner/API-side only, or also be enforced early inside `adapt` as a defensive check?

**Resolution.** Planner/API-side only. `adapt` is NOT a capability-gate site; it either renders successfully or raises `AdaptError::Unsupported*` when an irreducible feature gap surfaces during emission.

**Rationale.** Phase 5 ratified the `Capability` scope rule: the vocabulary covers only features that cannot be synthesized at an adapter's PlanBuilder layer (i.e. irreducible across the Substrait-handoff boundary). Adapter-internal rewrite strategies (CTE expansion, GROUPING SETS expansion, DISTINCT-aggregate emulation) are NOT capabilities and never reach the gate. With the vocabulary narrowed, in-`adapt` defensive checks would duplicate what the emission path already enforces — the SQL adapter knows from its own emit table whether `Capability::AsOfJoin` rendering is implemented; the Substrait adapter knows from its own URN map whether a function maps. Two roles for the same advertisement:

- **SQL-emitting adapters** — capabilities are **ergonomic hints**. `34` planner pre-flight gives authors a clear `34`-side diagnostic before emission; `38` api pre-`adapt` check is the same UX. `adapt`-time `AdaptError::Unsupported*` is the authoritative fallback.
- **`SubstraitAdapter`** — capabilities are the **handoff contract**. The Substrait plan declares what the consuming engine MUST support; semstrait cannot rewrite on the consumer's behalf across the process boundary.

**Cascade.** `35 §11.6` `Capability` enum trimmed (dropped `DistinctAggregate`; kept `RegexpMatch`, `RegexpExtract`, `IntervalLiteral`, `AsOfJoin`, `StructAccess`). `36 §6.1` `AdapterCapabilities` predicate roster reduced 1:1. `36 §6.2` rewritten to express the SQL-vs-Substrait asymmetry. `36 §6.3` adds the scope test for new variants. Per-adapter capability advertisements in `36 §5.1`–`§5.5` rewritten to use the narrowed vocabulary.

## Q-ADAPT-001 — `EngineAdapter::adapt` return shape  *[Closed — superseded by tuple-return ratification]*

**Status.** Closed. The eleventh-pass typed-kind cascade (2026-04-29) ratified the workspace-wide fail-fast tuple at `30 §7` and propagated it into `36 §3.1` / §17. `EngineAdapter::adapt` now signs as

```rust
fn adapt(
    &self,
    plan: &SemanticPlan,
    manifest: &SemanticManifest,
) -> Result<
    (EngineArtifact, Diagnostics<AdaptErrorKind>),
    (Diagnostic<AdaptErrorKind>, Diagnostics<AdaptErrorKind>),
>;
```

The dual-method `adapt_with_diagnostics` extension that this question prefigured is no longer needed: warnings ride alongside both the success arm and the failure arm of the workspace-wide tuple, keyed to the per-stage typed-kind enum `AdaptErrorKind` (`36 §10`).

**Original framing (preserved).** `36 §3.1` formerly ratified `adapt(&SemanticPlan, &SemanticManifest) -> Result<EngineArtifact, AdaptError>`. `30 §7`'s stage-result pattern recommends carrying `Vec<Diagnostic>` alongside successful output. The question was whether `adapt` should also carry `Vec<Diagnostic>` on success (e.g. "structural rewrite for `string_agg` applied on Spark") or stay bare with diagnostic appendage on `SemanticPlan.diagnostics` (`35 §3.1`).

- **Round-1 default**: bare `Result<EngineArtifact, AdaptError>`, with revisit gated on `34`'s planner-wiring draft.
- **Argument pro tuple-shape**: matches `30 §7`'s documented stage pattern; uniform across stages; decouples adapter-emitted diagnostics from the plan's diagnostic list (so a plan consumed twice by two adapters produces two independent lists).
- **Argument pro bare shape**: simpler call-site ergonomics; current-code parity; `SemanticPlan.diagnostics` accommodates the warnings already; `ADAPT_W_*` codes were reserved-but-unused in v1.

**Resolution.** `36` ratifies the workspace-wide tuple shape uniformly. Adapter-emitted warnings flow through `Diagnostics<AdaptErrorKind>` (the second tuple element on success; appended in either arm). `SemanticPlan.diagnostics` continues to carry planner-stage diagnostics; adapters do not mutate it. The retired `AdaptError` carrier and the old `ADAPT_W_*` numeric codes are gone (typed-kind discipline replaces them). Future adapter warnings are added as `AdaptErrorKind` variants with `Severity::Warning`.
